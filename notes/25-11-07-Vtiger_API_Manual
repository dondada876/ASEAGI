Introduction
The Vtiger REST API is a developer-friendly interface that enables seamless interaction between your Vtiger CRM instance and external systems such as mobile apps, websites, ERP tools, or automation platforms. It supports common web standards like HTTP and JSON, making it easy to use for both simple and complex integrations.

With REST APIs, you can securely perform a wide range of operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, deleting CRM records, syncing data, managing documents and files, executing workflows, tagging, and interacting with related modules. You can enable APIs to create multiple records with a single REST API. This helps in creating multiple module records at the same time. You can make a sub-request (another request) that uses data from the previous response and combines it with that response.

To test and understand API behavior before building your own integration, Vtiger provides a Postman Collection that contains all supported endpoints.

Benefits of Using REST API in Vtiger
The following are the benefits of using REST APIs in Vtiger:

Flexible Integrations: Easily connect Vtiger with external applications that don’t have built-in integrations.
Automation: Automate repetitive tasks like lead creation, record updates, or campaign tracking.
Scalability: Build scalable applications that interact with Vtiger CRM.
Customization: Extend Vtiger functionality for unique business requirements.
Time-Saving: Retrieve or update multiple records efficiently.

Format used for sending requests and receiving responses in REST APIs.

HTTP Methods

Web request types: GET (retrieve), POST (create/update), DELETE, etc.

Getting Started with Vtiger API
Endpoint
Each Vtiger instance has a unique API endpoint. You’ll use this as the base URL for all API requests

API Endpoint Format

https://your_instance.odx.vtiger.com/restapi/v1/vtiger/default

 
Replace your_instance with your Vtiger instance name
Replace odx with od1, od2, or od3 based on your instance URL
Authentication
Authentication is done using HTTP Basic Auth.

Username: Your CRM login email.
Access Key: Found in the My Preferences section in Vtiger.
Follow these steps to get your Access key and Username:

Log in to Vtiger CRM
Click the User Menu. 
Select My Preference. The My Preference page opens. 
Copy the following information:
Username: The login username for the CRM account
Access Key: A unique API key
The Access Key acts like a password for API operations.

Using Postman for API Testing
Follow these steps to test Vtiger REST APIs using Postman:

Install Postman from https://www.postman.com/downloads if you haven't already.
Create a new request and set the request URL to your Vtiger endpoint (e.g., https://your_instance.odx.vtiger.com/restapi/v1/vtiger/default).
Choose the HTTP method – either GET to fetch data or POST to send/update data.
Go to the Authorization tab and set the type to Basic Authentication. Enter your Vtiger username and access key.
If it's a POST request, switch to the Body tab and then enter your request payload.
Click Send to execute the request.
Review the response JSON in the output section to validate the API behavior. 
API Response Format
Sample Success Response

{

  "success": true,

  "result": {

    "id": "4x2063",

    "firstname": "John",

    "lastname": "Doe"

  }

}

Sample Failure Response

{

  "success": false,

  "error": {

    "code": "ACCESS_DENIED",

    "message": "Invalid authentication information"

  }

}

Record ID Format
Record IDs in the REST API use the format:

moduleIDxrecordID

Example: 4x2063 – where 4 is the module ID for Contacts, and 2063 is the record ID.

Postman Collection of APIs
You can use all the APIs below using the Postman collection. Use this link to access them.

Me
Authentication can be confirmed using this API before using any other operation. Response to this API can come in handy when the user-reference-id is required.

GET endpoint/me

Response

{

success: true,
result: {

id: user_record_id,
user_name: string,
first_name: string,
last_name: string,
email1: string

}

 }

ListTypes
You can get details about the module accessible to users through this API.

 
GET endpoint/listtypes?fieldTypeList=null

fieldTypeList - filter modules by field type available in those modules. If you want to see all, then pass null. For example, you want to see which modules have "grid" type of fields, then you can pass like below
endpoint/listtypes?fieldTypeList[]=grid

Response 

{

success: true,
result: {

types: [

module_name

],
information: {

module_name: {

isEntity: boolean,
label: string,
singular: string

}

}

}

 }

Describe
The Metadata of the module provides information about record permissions, blocks, and field configuration for performing further operations.

GET endpoint/describe?elementType=moduleName

Response 

{

success: true,
result: {

label: string,
name: string,
createable: boolean,
updateable: boolean,
deleteable: boolean,
retrieveable: boolean,
fields: [

name: string,
label: string,
mandatory: boolean,
quickcreate: boolean,
summaryfield: boolean,
headerfield: boolean,
default: value,
type: {

name: string,
length: size,
refersTo: reference_modulename_array,
picklistValues: value_label_array,
defaultValue: picklist_default_value

}
isunique: boolean,
nullable: boolean,
editable: boolean,
data: extended_info

],
inactivefields: field_information_array,
idPrefix: module_id_string,
isEntity: boolean,
allowDuplicates: boolean,
labelFields: string_or_array
..

}

 }

Create
This API enables you to create a single entity record. You are expected to send all the mandatory field values along with the optional fields for successful record creation. (Use Describe API to know more about the field mandatory configuration).

POST   endpoint/create?elementType=moduleName&element=convert_into_json_string ({field1: value1, field2=value2})

Response 

{

success: true,
result: {

id: record_id,
label: string,
field1: value1,
field2: value2,
...

}

 }

Note: Most entity records expect the Assigned To (assigne_user_id) field value to be set. This value can be set to user_record_id obtained through the Me API.

Retrieve
You can pull a piece of specific record information using this API.

GET endpoint/retrieve?id=record_id

Response 

  {

success: true,
result: {

id: record_id,
label: string,

GET endpoint/decrypt?id=record_id&fieldname=field_name

Response 

{

success: true,
result: field_value

 }

Update
When you intend to update specific fields of existing records, you can use this or the Revise API.
Note:
This API expects all the mandatory fields to be stated as part of the element parameter. 
If a field parameter is provided but left empty, the corresponding field in the CRM record will be updated with an empty value.
POST endpoint/update?element=convert_into_json_string({id:record_id, field1:revalue1, field2:value2})

Response 

{

success: true,
result: {

id: record_id,
label: string,
field1: revalue1,
field2: value2,
...

}

 }

Revise
This is similar to the Update API, but relaxes the constraint of re-stating the mandatory fields, but expects target fields that need to be updated. 

POST endpoint/revise?element=convert_into_json_string({id:record_id, field2:revalue2})

Response 

{

success: true,
result: {

id: record_id,
