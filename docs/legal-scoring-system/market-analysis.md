 For this case:
 \

tightenfactor0

 FC § 3044 VIOLATION ANALYSIS:\
\
Judge Failed To:\
├ Apply rebuttable presumption against mother (DV perpetrator)\
├ Require mother to overcome presumption with evidence\
├ Consider father's evidence of ongoing danger\
├ Conduct evidentiary hearing before custody change\
└ Make findings on record re: FC 3044 factors\
\
Impact:\
├ Child returned to dangerous situation\
├ Father's custodial rights terminated without hearing\
├ 343+ days separation\
└ Child remained exposed to abuser\
\
Procedural Compliance Score: 220/1000 [FAILED]\
Harm Caused: 980/1000 [CRITICAL]\

 RECOMMENDATIONS\

 tightenfactor0

 1. IMPLEMENT GRANULAR STATEMENT TRACKING\

 tightenfactor0

 ✅** YES
** - You need this level of detail for:\

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Perjury prosecution\

- Impeachment\

- Pattern proof\

- Credibility destruction\

 tightenfactor0

 2. AUTOMATED AI PROCESSING\

 tightenfactor0

 Process documents to:\

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Extract every statement\

- Score each statement (7 dimensions)\

- Flag lies/perjury automatically\

- Build timeline relationships\

- Calculate context scores\

 tightenfactor0

 3. PARTY PROFILE SYSTEM\

 tightenfactor0

 Track:\

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Overall credibility (updated real-time)\

- Violation history\

- Risk scores (flight, compliance, harm)\

- Bad faith patterns\

- Protective recommendations\

 tightenfactor0

 4. PRIORITY ENERGY ALLOCATION\

 tightenfactor0

 Based on scores, focus on:\

 tightenfactor0

 HIGH PRIORITY (Scores 900+):
 \

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Jamaica Hague lie (SMS: 978) - PERJURY PROSECUTION\

- "No US ties" lie (SMS: 968) - PERJURY PROSECUTION\

- "Father alienating" (SMS: 947) - Contradicts her 2021 admission\

- Mother's 2021 admission (DMS: 966) - SMOKING GUN\

- Dr. Brown's report (DMS: 975) - EXPERT EVIDENCE\

 tightenfactor0

 MEDIUM PRIORITY (700-899):
 \

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Other perjury statements\

- Pattern evidence\

- Violation documentation\

 tightenfactor0

 LOW PRIORITY (<700):
 \

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Administrative matters\

- Background information\

 tightenfactor0

 5. EVIDENCE PACKAGE PRIORITIES\

 tightenfactor0

 For W&I § 388 Petition:
 \

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Mother's 2021 admission (proves father's concerns legitimate)\

- Dr. Brown's forensic exam (proves abuse)\

- This false ex parte (proves dismissal was fraud)\

- Timeline showing investigation blocked\

 tightenfactor0

 For Perjury Referral:
 \

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Statement 8 (Jamaica Hague) + proof it's false\

- Statement 9 (No US ties) + proof father is US citizen\

- Statement 2 (False allegations) + mother's 2021 admission\

- Materiality proof (orders issued based on these lies)\

 tightenfactor0

 For CCP § 473(d) (Void Orders):
 \

 -720
tightenfactor0

- Judge's failure to apply FC 3044\

- Orders obtained through perjury\

- Lack of evidentiary hearing\

- Jurisdictional defects\

 CONTEXT WINDOW OPTIMIZATION\

 tightenfactor0

 Given my remaining ~35,000 tokens, 
** what would be most valuable?
** \

 tightenfactor0

 Option A:
 Generate SQL schema + Python code to implement this system\

** Option B:
** Score your other critical documents using this methodology\

** Option C:
** Create the complete evidence package for W&I 388 with scoring\

** What's most useful right now?
