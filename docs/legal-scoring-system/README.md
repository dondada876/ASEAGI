- Forensic analysis (like FBI methods)
- All focused on child protection cases

### Target Users
1. **Pro se protective parents** (free forever)
2. Family law attorneys
3. CPS agencies
4. District attorneys
5. Child advocacy organizations

### Impact Goal
Ensure no child's voice is silenced, no protective parent punished, no abuser escapes through legal manipulation.

## System Capabilities

### What This System Does

1. **Legal Precision at Scale**
   - Tracks individual statements (not just documents)
   - Context-aware scoring (timing, relationships, patterns)
   - Quantifies bad faith behaviors objectively
   - **Power:** Turns subjective credibility into objective data

2. **Evidence Weaponization**
   - Identifies perjury automatically
   - Maps contradictions across time
   - Proves patterns mathematically
   - **Power:** 22 lies on one page becomes quantified ammunition

3. **Predictive Decision Support**
   - Party credibility scores predict outcomes
   - Risk assessment guides protective measures
   - Motion strength scores prioritize strategy
   - **Power:** Data-driven litigation strategy

4. **Judicial Accountability**
   - Tracks judicial compliance/violations
   - Documents harm from errors
   - Builds appellate record systematically
   - **Power:** Objective proof of judicial failure

5. **Case Complexity Management**
   - 156+ documents become searchable database
   - AI processes what humans can't at scale
   - Never miss critical evidence
   - **Power:** Levels playing field vs. resourced opponents

## Technical Architecture

### 5-Level Hierarchy
All scoring levels use 0-1000 scale for consistency:

```
LEVEL 5: JUSTICE MASTER SCORE (Party/Case-Level)
           ↓
LEVEL 4: LEGAL CREDIT SCORE (Motion/Filing Collection)
           ↓
LEVEL 3: DOCUMENT MASTER SCORE (Per Document)
           ↓
LEVEL 2: PAGE/SECTION SCORE (Per Page)
           ↓
LEVEL 1: STATEMENT MICRO-SCORE (Individual Claim/Statement)
```

### Key Features

**Statement Micro-Score (SMS)** includes:
- Truth-Lie Score (TLS): 0=aggravated perjury, 1000=absolute truth
- Intent-Culpability Score (ICS): 0=heroic protection, 1000=corrupt
- Bad Faith Quantification (BFQ): Timing manipulation, forum shopping, evidence concealment, child endangerment, procedural abuse
- Context-Relationship Score (CRS): Temporal proximity, relational significance, pattern detection, legal consequences
