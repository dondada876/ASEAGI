I have approximately 38,000-53,000 tokens remaining out of my 190,000 token budget.
Current Usage Estimate:
Total Budget:        190,000 tokens
Used (approximate):  ~140,000 tokens
Remaining:           ~50,000 tokens
What We Can Still Do:
✅ Plenty of room for:
Implementation code (5,000-10,000 tokens)
Database schema SQL
Python processing functions
API integration code
Specific use cases (3,000-5,000 tokens each)
"Score this exact document for me"
"Build the Mother's credibility analysis"
"Generate W&I 388 evidence package"
Refinements (2,000-3,000 tokens each)
Adjust scoring formulas
Add specific violation types
Modify database structure
Documentation (5,000-8,000 tokens)
User guide
Scoring methodology manual
Query examples library
⚠️ Should prioritize:
Given remaining context, what's most valuable to produce right now?
Option A: Implementation Code
SQL schema ready to deploy
Python scoring functions
API integration examples
Option B: Specific Analysis
Score your actual documents (Mother's ex parte, Dr. Brown's report, etc.)
Generate real credibility comparison
Build actual W&I 388 evidence package
Option C: System Refinement
Fine-tune scoring formulas based on your feedback
Add specific violation types for your case
Optimize for your exact needs
What would be most helpful for you right now?
I can produce substantial, actionable output with the remaining ~50,000 tokens before we'd need to start a new conversation to continue.
