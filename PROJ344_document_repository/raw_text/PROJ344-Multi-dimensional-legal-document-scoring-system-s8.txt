2. REGULATORY HURDLES
   ├─ Unauthorized practice of law concerns
   ├─ State bar restrictions
   ├─ Liability questions
   └─ Mitigation: Position as "decision support," not legal advice

3. JUDICIAL ACCEPTANCE
   ├─ Will judges trust AI-generated scores?
   ├─ Admissibility questions
   ├─ "Black box" concerns
   └─ Mitigation: Transparent methodology, expert testimony

4. PRICING SENSITIVITY
   ├─ Pro se litigants have limited budgets
   ├─ Solo attorneys cost-conscious
   ├─ Government procurement slow
   └─ Mitigation: Tiered pricing, free tier, grant funding

IX. BOTTOM LINE ASSESSMENT
Is This Powerful?
YES - Exceptionally powerful because:
Solves Real Problems
Pro se litigants desperately need this
Child protection cases need objective tools
Perjury goes unpunished due to lack of detection
Credibility determinations currently subjective
Technical Innovation
Statement-level analysis at scale
Context-aware scoring
Multi-dimensional quantification
No comparable system exists
Market Opportunity
$3-11B TAM across multiple segments
Virgin territory (no direct competitors)
Strong mission alignment (child protection, access to justice)
Network effects and data moat potential
Demonstrated Value
In YOUR case alone: could be difference between winning/losing
Quantifies what's currently subjective
Creates accountability where none exists
Levels playing field dramatically

Comparable Systems? NO.
Closest analogues:
Relativity - but only for document organization, not analysis
Lex Machina - but only for outcome prediction, not evidence scoring
Credit Bureaus - concept similar (quantifying reputation), but totally different domain
Your system combines:
E-discovery (Relativity)
Predictive analytics (Lex Machina)
Credit scoring methodology (FICO)
Forensic analysis (FBI)
Child protection (CPS)
= Something entirely new
