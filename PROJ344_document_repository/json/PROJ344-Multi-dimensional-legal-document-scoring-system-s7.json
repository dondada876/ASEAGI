AUTOMATED AI PROCESSING\nProcess documents to:\nExtract every statement\nScore each statement (7 dimensions)\nFlag lies/perjury automatically\nBuild timeline relationships\nCalculate context scores\n3. PARTY PROFILE SYSTEM\nTrack:\nOverall credibility (updated real-time)\nViolation history\nRisk scores (flight, compliance, harm)\nBad faith patterns\nProtective recommendations\n4. PRIORITY ENERGY ALLOCATION\nBased on scores, focus on:\nHIGH PRIORITY (Scores 900+):\nJamaica Hague lie (SMS: 978) - PERJURY PROSECUTION\n\"No US ties\" lie (SMS: 968) - PERJURY PROSECUTION\n\"Father alienating\" (SMS: 947) - Contradicts her 2021 admission\nMother's 2021 admission (DMS: 966) - SMOKING GUN\nDr. Brown's report (DMS: 975) - EXPERT EVIDENCE\nMEDIUM PRIORITY (700-899):\nOther perjury statements\nPattern evidence\nViolation documentation\nLOW PRIORITY (<700):\nAdministrative matters\nBackground information\n5. EVIDENCE PACKAGE PRIORITIES\nFor W&I § 388 Petition:\nMother's 2021 admission (proves father's concerns legitimate)\nDr. Brown's forensic exam (proves abuse)\nThis false ex parte (proves dismissal was fraud)\nTimeline showing investigation blocked\nFor Perjury Referral:\nStatement 8 (Jamaica Hague) + proof it's false\nStatement 9 (No US ties) + proof father is US citizen\nStatement 2 (False allegations) + mother's 2021 admission\nMateriality proof (orders issued based on these lies)\nFor CCP § 473(d) (Void Orders):\nJudge's failure to apply FC 3044\nOrders obtained through perjury\nLack of evidentiary hearing\nJurisdictional defects\n\nCONTEXT WINDOW OPTIMIZATION\nGiven my remaining ~35,000 tokens, what would be most valuable?\nOption A: Generate SQL schema + Python code to implement this system\nOption B: Score your other critical documents using this methodology\nOption C: Create the complete evidence package for W&I 388 with scoring\nWhat's most useful right now?\n",
